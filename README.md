Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players take turns placing their marks (usually X and O) on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
My Tic-Tac-Toe web application brings this timeless game to the digital realm, allowing players to enjoy it on various devices and platforms.
Players can choose to compete against a friend on the same device.
